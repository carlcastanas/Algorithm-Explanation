1. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. This can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Divide and conquer is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking a problem down into smaller sub-problems, solving them independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

2. Here's an example implementation of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number using the divide and conquer strategy:
"""
# Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: if n is greater than 1, call the factorial function on n-1 and multiply by n
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
"""
This defines a function called factorial that takes a single argument, n.
"""
    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
"""
This is the base case of the recursive function. If n is either 0 or 1, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 or 1 is 1.
"""
    # Recursive case: if n is greater than 1, call the factorial function on n-1 and multiply by n
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
"""
This is the recursive case of the function. If n is greater than 1, the function calls itself with n-1 as the argument and multiplies the result by n. This is because the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n-1.
