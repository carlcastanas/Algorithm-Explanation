1.First, you need to understand the algorithm you want to analyze in terms of its time complexity.
2.Once you understand the algorithm, identify the statements or operations within it that take up the most time, and count the number of times each statement or operation is executed based on the input size.
3.Express the number of times these statements or operations are executed as a function of the input size.
4.Simplify the expression by removing any constant factors, lower-order terms, and any non-dominant terms.
5.Determine the resulting function's growth rate or order, which gives you the algorithm's Big-O time complexity.

Here's an example in Python:

Let's say we want to calculate the time complexity of the following algorithm that adds up all the numbers in a list:
"""
# function to sum all elements of an array
def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for i in arr:
        total += i
    return total

# initialize counter variable
counter = 0

# test the function with different input sizes
for n in range(10, 100, 10):
    arr = list(range(n))
    sum_array(arr)
    # increment counter variable for each operation performed
    counter += n

# print the total number of operations performed
print("Total operations:", counter)
  
"""  
We understand that this algorithm iterates through each element of the input list once, and performs a constant time addition operation on each element.
The operation that takes up the most time is the addition operation inside the for loop. We count the number of times it is executed based on the input size, which is equal to the length of the input list.
We express the number of times the addition operation is executed as a function of the input size: n, where n is the length of the input list. In this case, the addition operation is executed n times.
We simplify the expression by removing constant factors and lower-order terms. The only term that matters is n, so the simplified expression is O(n).
We determine the resulting function's growth rate or order, which is linear. Therefore, the algorithm's Big-O time complexity is O(n).
